# Project Title
this the project of Zybook lab 5.2. 
For this project, the user will input a wall's height and width. Calculate and output the wall's area.
Second, calculate and output the amount of paint in gallons needed to paint the wall (floating point). Assume a gallon of paint covers 350 square feet. Store this value in a variable. Output the amount of paint needed using the %f conversion specifier.
Third, calculate and output the number of 1 gallon cans needed to paint the wall. Hint: Use a math function to round up to the nearest gallon.
 Next, the user for a color they want to paint the walls. Calculate and output the total cost of the paint cans depending on which color is chosen. Hint: Use a dictionary to associate each paint color with its respective cost. Red paint costs $35 per gallon can, blue paint costs $25 per gallon can, and green paint costs $23 per gallon can.
